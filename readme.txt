COMP-476 Assignment 3
Winter '20

To whole folder is the unity project folder. This uses Unity 2019.2.17.
To build it, the only thing that should be done is to add
both provided scenes to the build settings;
Menu.unity MUST have scene index 0
World.unity MUST have scene index 1

No other steps should be recquired to compile.
The code uses .NET 4.x backend and C# 7 features, so this must be enabled as well

Precompiled binaries of the game is available in the folder "Compiled"


How to play:
W-S/Up-Down to go forwards and backwards
A-D/Left-Right to turn 90 degrees to the left and right
LeftCTRL/Space to shoot

Pick up a powerup to gain a triple barrel tank for 7 seconds.
Once a player is dead, the game restarts automatically after 5 seconds.
If one player leaves, another can join the room to continue the game.
Named rooms are supported.
